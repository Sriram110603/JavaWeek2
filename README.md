## Overview

This week was focused on exploring the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java, including real-world concepts like inheritance and encapsulation. We learned how to use constructors, overload methods, and understand how `this`, `super`, `static`, and `final` work in Java. The week concluded with proper use of access modifiers and creating packages for modular code structure.
